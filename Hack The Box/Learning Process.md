# Mindset
## Way Of Thinking
### Everyone Starts From Rock Bottom
+ According to HTB, there are two types of people they encounter:
1. *Those that do not know anything*
2. *Those who think they do not know anything*

+ Therefore, when dealing with with these people, we should always make sure that we respect them.
+ Meaning that you have to teach them and answer their questions without making them feel stupid.

## Think Outside The Box
+ When we went to school, for mathematics for example, we would be taught the formula, how to use it, and then we would be given a problem to solve.
+ The issue is we never cared to see how it actually worked, we just blindly followed the formula.
+ Same goes for religion, science, politics, etc. We are always taught to follow the rules, but we never question them.
+ Society has **conditioned** us to think in a certain way, and we never question it.
+ A hacker's mindset is to actually **break this conditioning**, which is what we call 'thinking outside the box'.

## Occam's Razor
+ This is a principle that states that the most simple theory is the most probable theory. This is the principle:
> The most straightforward theory is preferable to all others of several sufficient possible explanations for the same state of facts. In other words: The simplest explanation is always the most probable.

+ An example of this is when a person's PC is not working, they immediately have various assumptions such as: maybe the motherboard is not working, maybe the RAM is burnt, etc.
+ Then through the process of elimination, we will check all assumptions one-by-one by checking the motherboard, checking the RAM, etc.
+ What Occam is saying is that we should always check the simplest thing first, such as the following question:
> Why is the PC not getting any power?

+ With this basic question, you first check if the cable is actually attached to the wall, and check the overall power cable connection, etc. This type of thinking becomes very beneficial when we go into SQL injections, Cross-Site Scripting, etc.

+ In the context of penetration testing, the most applicable statement for this principle would be:
> The simplest explanation for the best approach to penetration testing is that we work with the information we can get.

## Talent
+ People perceive talent as something that a person got from birth. Meaning, a talented person will be easily able to do a certain task without any training or prior knowledge.
+ Most people think that genetics define a person's talent.
+ But the truth is, if you observe a talented person, what they are really good at is learning something within a very short period of time.
+ For example, if you take two people, give them a guitar, and the first person takes 1 week to learn the guitar, and the second person takes 6 months to learn the guitar, then people would think that the first person is *talented*.
+ The thing is, the first person has developed a learning process (often since childhood) that has carried over to all aspects of his life.
+ Children can easily learn things, because they do not complicate things. A child's decisions are almost always like Occam's principle.
+ Also, if you previously knew to play a bass, and you were given a guitar, it would not take you a long time to practice, this is because the learning process you used to previously learn the bass can be applied when learning the guitar.

# Way Of Learning
## The Anatomy Of A Problem
> A problem is an emotional state. Without emotions, it is just a situation.
+ Basically, the definition of a 'problem' is a situation that you are not happy with. So, there is emotion involved in a problem.
+ Usually, when you try a lot of things, and when you don't get the outcome you want, it becomes a problem.
+ There are may ways to solve a situation, and you may be just trying one way from one point-of-view. That is what usually happens to most people (including me).

## Goalsetting & Emotional State
+ Imagine that you wanted to do something, and you encounter some setback. Usually, after many tries, you might be discouraged.
+ But if you have a clearly defined goal of what you wanted, you can actually come up with different techniques to achieve that goal, and the likelihood of you finishing what you started is high.
+ When you know what you are doing, your emotional state is more positive, and this is the emotional state you should be in when handling all situations to reduce the likelihood of it being a problem.

## Learning Efficiency/Types
+ When starting to learn something, it is beneficial if we first answer these two questions:
> What do we already know?
> What do we not know yet?

+ As stated in the [Learning Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_pyramid), practical experience or taught knowledge is the highest form of retained knowledge, and we should try to do this if we wanted to remember most of what we learn.

+ Active learning yields better results than passive learning. Active learning is when you are actually doing something, and passive learning is when you are just reading or listening to something.

+ We mostly will feel like learning when we have a good motivation. If we feel demotivated, and want to bring back up our motivation, it is important that we recognize our past progresses, even if they were very small.
> Progress is noticeable when the question that tortured us has lost its meaning.

## The Brain
+ Humans have two types of thoughts:
1. **Conscious thoughts**
2. **Subconscious thoughts**

+ Remember when you are looking somewhere, just lost, staring at something, in your own world. That is when the subconscious mind has taken over. In those types of situations, you cannot consciously change the situation. You are not in charge.
+ Conscious thoughts are when you have full control on what is happening, you can look away when you want to, etc.
+ The subconscious mind is fueled by emotions. When you are in a bad mood, you are more likely to be in your subconscious mind. When you are in a good mood, you are more likely to be in your conscious mind.

## The Will & The Goal
+ This basically is the opposite of 'fear'.
+ Fear is when you don't want to do something, commonly because you don't know how to do it.
> Fear is a state and the product of our imagination of the future and its consequences where the present is suppressed.

+ Again, having a well-defined goal is paramount to achieving what you want.
> The results of a meta-analysis of over 200 studies with more than 40,000 participants show that over 90 percent of people are significantly more successful in achieving their dreams by setting challenging and specific goals.

# Learning Overview
## Documentation & Organization
+ When we are writing our documentations, it is important to put ourselves in the shoes of the writer, and see how a reader will understand our documentation.
+ You should also try to organize/structure your reports.
+ Also, you have to be a very organized person with proper management. You can use checklists, to-do lists, etc.

# The Process
## Focus vs Attention
+ Focus means that you stop all the other work you do, and give all your attention to one thing.
+ Attention is kind of different. Imagine you were in a rush, you were both:
    1. Searching for your keys
    2. Looking at your clock every 5 seconds
+ You are giving your attention to two things at once, so you are not focused on one thing.
+ Another key definition of attention is that it is a subconscious mental process that determines how much focus you will give to something. It is determined by needs, goals, personal beliefs, etc.
+ If you are keen on cybersecurity, you will give more attention to cybersecurity-related things. You don't have to do anything, you will be be subconsciously guided to doing cybersecurity-related things.

## Comfort
+ The [Yerkes-Dodson law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerkes%E2%80%93Dodson_law) explains that there is a certain level of performance you can experience, but you will loose that performance when you reach a certain level of stress, and it is important to manage that stress.
+ Also the writer gives an introduction into what the comfort zone is, and ends it with a very interesting example:
> Now imagine you are standing at the entrance in front of a massive dark forest in the middle of the night. This forest is so dense that no daylight can get through the treetops. To the left and right of this forest, some cliffs are much too steep to climb down, and we know that somewhere in this forest, there is the one thing we want to have.
> Will you go inside and look for it?
> Common sense would do anything not to.
> But what if the thing you want is a hundred yards further into the forest, and it is brightly lit?
> That is the thing that will fulfill you the way we have always wanted it to.
> Would you risk it now?

## Fear
+ There are two types of fear:
1. Fear from dangerous situations
2. Interpreted fear (Fear from the unknown)

+ The fear you get from dangerous situations are very necessary for survival, but the fear of the unknown (such as getting scared when watching a horror movie, and someone bangs on the door) is not really something you need in your life.

> People fear what might happen in the future while not considering the present.

This is also explained by [Will Smith](https://youtu.be/VsTBCQ2MnRM).

+ Also, if you try to start something, and someone tells you that it is a bad idea, you will fail, and induce fear into your, this is the statement that you should follow:
> Only the person who has taken the exact same journey as you can evaluate you and your decisions. Everything else is only assumptions.

## Questions
+ There are no 'good' and 'bad' questions.
+ Lets say that you asked a question such as:
> 'how to hack Facebook?'
+ You asked this because you did not know that Facebook is very protected and is mostly not hackable.
+ So, this question came up due to a lack of knowledge, and therefore, this questions does not add value to the conversation (or your goal's path that you are taking).
+ But lets say you asked the following question:
> 'Will brute-forcing Facebook's OTP code with a null-byte at the end for every rate limited request bypass rate-limits?'
+ This type of a question has two features:
    1. It is very precise
    2. It gives your goal a path (or reroutes the current path to a more optimal path)

+ There seems to be three types of questions a person will ask:
    1. To understand the reason for an event (past)
    2. To experience something completely new and to understand the way something works (present)
    3. to predict the effect of an event (future)

> A question is a sentence that can extract (or make you extract) information.

+ This goes into a *Relationship-Oriented-Questioning Model* which is really interesting, but you have to actually read the content, I cannot write a note about it.

## Handling Frustration

+ This section talks about your *frustration-threshold*, which basically is the maximum amount of frustration you can deal with at a given period of time.

+ We have to identify that **frustration is a subconscious process**. It will be in the background for a long time if you choose it to be subconscious.

+ The author explains that it is very important that we **consciously** deal with frustration, as it will most likely be beneficial for you later throughout the day. To understand this, assume the following example:

> Imagine that you have to catch a train. To catch it in time, we are forced to run about 2 miles quickly. We take all excuses and changes out of the situation for this example ("Think Outside the Box") and determine that you have no other choice in this example. We will be sweaty, maybe we will even get a bit dirty and out of breath, and maybe we will even miss our train because it came too early for once.
> Furthermore, now let us change the situation a little bit and imagine that you consciously decide to leave the house too late and run fast to catch the train.
