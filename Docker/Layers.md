# What Are Layers In Docker
+ When you write a Dockerfile, you specify a list of commands.
+ At build time, one new layer is generated for each command.
+ For example, lets take the following Dockerfile:
```Dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.7
RUN apk add --no-cache python3
RUN apk add --no-cache py3-pip
```

+ This Dockerfile will generate 3 layers:
  1. The base image layer.
  2. The layer generated by the first `apk add` command.
  3. The layer generated by the second `apk add` command.

+ You can verify this by running `docker history <image-name>`.
+ The output of this command will show you the layers that make up the image.
```
$ docker image history meeranh/hello-world

IMAGE          CREATED        CREATED BY                            SIZE
70b74b067a2d   2 months ago   CMD ["Hello World"]                   0B
<missing>      2 months ago   CMD ["This is not printed"]           0B
<missing>      2 months ago   ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]                   0B
<missing>      2 months ago   /bin/sh -c #(nop)  CMD ["/bin/sh"]    0B
<missing>      2 months ago   /bin/sh -c #(nop) ADD file:37a76e...  7.37MB
```

+ Also, running `docker image inspect <image-name>` will show you the layers in the `RootFS` section.
