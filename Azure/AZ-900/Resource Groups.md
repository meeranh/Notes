# Resource
+ A resource is a basic unit of deployment in Azure.
+ It could be a virtual machine, a database, a storage account, etc.
+ If you have hundreds of resources, it would be confusing to manage them all.

# Resource Groups
+ In Azure, you can group your resources together in a resource group.
+ For example, lets say that you have databases, VMs, and storage for "Project A".
+ You also have databases, VMs, and storage for "Project B".
+ It would be confusing if we didn't group them together.
+ You can create a resource group for "Project A" and another for "Project B".
+ Then you can assign all the resources for "Project A" to the "Project A" resource group.
